# Energy Management Optimization with Reinforcement Learning

This project explores optimizing energy management in a renewable energy setup, aiming to balance energy production, storage, and grid interaction to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. The system includes solar energy production, battery storage, and grid connectivity, creating a complex environment where decisions about energy flow must consider real-time data, forecasted demands, and the wear on storage systems.

## Project Goals

The primary goal is to develop an intelligent agent that can dynamically manage energy flows in a simulated environment to:
1. **Maximize Self-Consumption**: Utilize as much locally produced energy as possible, reducing reliance on external sources.
2. **Optimize Grid Interactions**: Decide when to feed surplus energy back to the grid and when to purchase from it, taking into account variable pricing.
3. **Preserve Battery Health**: Balance the use of battery storage with its degradation to ensure long-term sustainability.

By combining forecasts of energy production and consumption with real-time energy flow management, this project seeks to address challenges typical in renewable energy communities, where demand and supply often fluctuate unpredictably.

## Approach

To achieve these objectives, we use **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, specifically a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which allows the agent to learn and improve its strategies through trial and error within a simulated environment. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

- **Simulation Components**: The environment simulates real-world dynamics, including solar energy production, energy consumption, battery storage, and grid interactions. Each component (e.g., `BatterySim`, `EnergySim`, and `GridSim`) models different aspects of the energy system to provide the RL agent with a realistic decision-making environment.
- **RL Agent and Environment**: The RL agent interacts with a custom `InverterEnv` environment, where it takes actions like charging or discharging the battery, deciding on grid purchases or sales, and adjusting energy flow. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on energy costs, grid prices, and battery wear.
- **Training and Evaluation**: The agent is trained to optimize long-term rewards, balancing energy costs with operational efficiency. Training is conducted over many simulated days, and the results are evaluated to gauge the performance of the learned energy management strategies.

## Challenges and Opportunities

This project addresses several challenges typical in renewable energy management:
- **Variability in Supply and Demand**: Renewable energy sources, like solar power, are inherently variable. The system must predict and adapt to fluctuations in both energy production and consumption.
- **Battery Degradation**: Intensive use of battery storage accelerates wear, requiring the agent to weigh the benefits of using stored energy against the cost of battery degradation.
- **Real-time Decision-making**: By training on simulated data, the RL agent learns to make real-time decisions, enhancing responsiveness and adaptability.

By developing a model that can optimize these decisions, this project aims to contribute to more efficient, resilient, and cost-effective energy management solutions suitable for renewable energy communities and similar setups.
